My interpretation of 3D minesweeper, independent of internet ideas. Although AI made it too, I don't think it is idea-l lol. 

controls:
-a/d or right/left arrows to switch between levels. you can also use level list.
-rmb to reveal squares. 
-lmb to flag

how does it work?
number represents the amount of mines that it touches.
the trick is: it touches squares in 3x3 area on level where it is AND level higher and lower. Meaning, techincaly 3x3x3 cube, but there are layers so it has no volume, when 3D objects do.

I tested it, and it's pretty fun to figure out, how normal minesweeper patterns work in 3D. 
if you are not ready, you can always check out normal minesweeper in 'minesweeper' repo.
